      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

<p align="justify">
I am a sociologist specializing in digital subjectivation and platform subjectivities. My research examines how practices of self-(re)presentation in digital environments, ranging from dating apps and professional networks to AI-generated images and virtual worlds, produce, negotiate, and contest subject positions. Working at the intersection of visual, cultural, and digital sociology, I investigate how platform design, affordances, and fields of value structure the emergence of selves and subjects, and how mediated practices simultaneously reproduce cultural formations and enable new or contested modes of being.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In my PhD project, I analyzed online dating profiles across 13 countries to examine the construction of attractiveness through visual self-representation and to identify how culture, gender, and sexuality shape these visual practices.
